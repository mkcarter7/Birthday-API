# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: RESTART REQUIRED

## Current Status
Your Django development server is running but hasn't loaded the latest changes. Firebase needs to be properly initialized.

## Action Required
You MUST restart your Django development server:

### Step 1: Stop the Server
In your terminal where Django is running:
- Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Ctrl+Break` on Windows)

### Step 2: Start the Server
Run:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Why This is Needed
- Firebase initialization happens when Django starts
- Environment variables from .env are loaded at startup
- Recent permission changes need to take effect

## After Restart
Your server should show:
```
Firebase initialized successfully
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
October 31, 2025 - XX:XX:XX
Django version 4.2.XX, using settings 'birthday.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Test It
After restarting:
1. Try viewing guest book: `GET /api/guestbook/` should work (public)
2. Try adding message: `POST /api/guestbook/` with Firebase token
3. Check server logs for successful responses

**The backend code is ready - just needs a fresh server start!**
