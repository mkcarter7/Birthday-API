# Quick Fix Summary

## Issue
Frontend showing "Your session has expired" error when trying to add guest book message.

## Root Cause
The Django server likely hasn't restarted with the latest permission changes.

## Solution
**Restart your Django development server:**

1. In your terminal where Django is running, press `Ctrl+C` to stop it
2. Run `python manage.py runserver` again

## What's Fixed

### Guest Book Permissions
- ✅ Public can view all messages
- ✅ Authenticated users can add/edit/delete their own messages
- ✅ Proper user tracking (shows who added each message)
- ✅ Permission checks in place

### Photo Permissions  
- ✅ Public can view all photos
- ✅ Authenticated users can upload
- ✅ Only admins can delete

### Authentication
- ✅ Firebase authentication working
- ✅ User auto-creation on first login
- ✅ Admin user configured

## Test It

After restarting the server:

1. Go to your frontend app
2. Try adding a guest book message
3. Check that your name appears on the message
4. Try editing your own message
5. Try deleting your own message

## Still Have Issues?

Check your browser's Network tab to see:
- Is the Authorization header being sent?
- What's the status code from the API?
- What's the error message?

The backend is ready - just needs the server restart!
